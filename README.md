# Ray Tracer

![Example Photo](example.png "Example Photo")

## What this is
This project is a path tracer that was built using Peter Shirley's "Ray Tracing in One Weekend" book as a base. I've also added some extra features of my own, such as multithreading and .png exporting.

## How it works
Simply compile the program (no external dependencies needed), run it, and the image will be output to the same directory as the executable.

## Credit
A big thanks to Peter Shirley for his fantastic Ray Tracing series of books. Thanks to the contributors of the [stb project](https://github.com/nothings/stb) as well, for making exporting to .png incredibly simple.
